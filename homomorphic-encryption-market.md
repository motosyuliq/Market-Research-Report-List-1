<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Homomorphic Encryption Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Partially Homomorphism</li><li>Fully Homomorphism</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Homomorphic encryption (HE) can be categorized into partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). PHE supports specific operations, such as addition or multiplication, on encrypted data without revealing the data itself, making it suitable for certain applications like secure computation. In contrast, FHE allows both operations to be performed on encrypted data without limitation, enabling more complex calculations while preserving privacy. The choice between PHE and FHE depends on the level of security required and computational efficiency needed for specific tasks.</p></p>
