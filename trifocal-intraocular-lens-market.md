<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trifocal Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophobic Acrylic IOLs</li><li>Hydrophilic Acrylic IOLs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Trifocal Intraocular Lens (IOL) market includes two main types: hydrophobic acrylic IOLs and hydrophilic acrylic IOLs. Hydrophobic acrylic IOLs are designed to repel water, enhancing stability and reducing posterior capsule opacification, making them suitable for high-performance vision. Conversely, hydrophilic acrylic IOLs are more water-attracting, offering high biocompatibility and a softer feel for improved comfort. Both types aim to provide patients with multifocal vision, allowing effective sight at near, intermediate, and far distances, enhancing overall visual quality post-cataract surgery.</p></p>
