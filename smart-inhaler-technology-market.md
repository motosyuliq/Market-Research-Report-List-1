<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Inhaler Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inhalers</li><li>Nebulizers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smart inhaler technology encompasses devices designed to improve medication adherence and management in respiratory conditions. The market is primarily divided into inhalers and nebulizers. Inhalers, which include metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs), are portable devices that deliver medication directly to the lungs. Nebulizers, on the other hand, convert liquid medication into mist, making it easier for patients, especially children or those with severe conditions, to inhale. Both types utilize connectivity features to track usage and provide reminders.</p></p>
